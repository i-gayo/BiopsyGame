## Game instructions
Users are shown images of the MR volume, prostate and lesion masks, along with a brachytherapy grid. 

To select a grid position, simply click on a desired grid point, then close the image. A new image will pop up with an updated screen : a yellow dot signifies the previously visited grid positions. 
The user repeats the same process until all 5 biopsy needles have been fired.


##Â Comparison with RL predictions 
The user can also choose to fire grid positions suggested by trained RL agents.
